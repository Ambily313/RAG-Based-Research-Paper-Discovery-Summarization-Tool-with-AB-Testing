2025-10-01 20:04:54.930720,You Only Need Less Attention at Each Stage in Vision Transformers,You Only Need Less Attention at Each Stage in Vision Transformers,A,The advent of Vision Transformers (ViTs) marks a substantial paradigm shift in the realm of computer vision. ViTs capture the global information of images through self-attention modules. We argue against the necessity of computing the attention scores in every layer. We propose the Less-Attention Vision Transformer (LaViT),"ViTs capture the global information of images through self-attention modules, which perform dot product computations among patchified image tokens . The computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tokens, which is a major hindrance to the practical application of ViTs ."
